            <p>Founded by a group of women from a diverse range of nationalities, socio-economic and career backgrounds, M4G is an initiative that is part of the Harvard University Franklin Program. Our goal is to unite professionals who want to learn, expand their network, and grow their potential â€“ while giving back to their community!</p>
            <p>We encourage and equip people who are interested in giving back to their community to learn the skills needed to effectively mentor others in their academic journey, career, and life. We help people find new ways to contribute to their community, improve their soft skills, connect with like-minded people, and gain experience for their own career development.</p>
