        <p>Founded by a group of women from a diverse range of nationalities, socio-economic and career backgrounds, M4G is an initiative that is part of the Harvard University Franklin Program. Our goal is to unite professionals who want to learn, expand their network, and grow their potential â€“ while giving back to their community!</p>
